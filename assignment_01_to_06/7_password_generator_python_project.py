# Password Generator Python Project
# In this Code With Tomi tutorial, you will learn how to build a random password generator. 
# You will collect data from the user on the number of passwords and their lengths
#  and output a collection of passwords with random characters.
# This project will give you more practice working with for loops and the 
# random Python module.
