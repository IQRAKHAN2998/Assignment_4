# Mad libs Python Project
# In this Kylie Ying tutorial, you will learn how to get input from the user, work with f-strings, and see your results printed to the console.

# This is a great starter project to get comfortable doing string concatenation in Python.

    The {animal} froze for a moment, then dashed away in confusion! 

    {name} couldn't stop laughing and just {reaction}.
    What an unforgettable adventure at {place}!
